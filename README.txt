*** Instructions on how to run the examples ***

- Navigate to the language_design implementation directory through a terminal,
this can be achieved with the cd command like: cd path/langauge_design

- When you are in the correct directory, enter: ./denise examples/exam1.txt
as result the first example will run, to run any other of the five tests, the 
only part that changes is the "exam1.txt" to "exam2.txt" and so on.
