*** Build instructions ***

The tools that are required in order to compile the language are the following:
flex, bison and gcc.

Gcc is pre-installed in any GNU/Linux distribution, in order to install flex and
bison on a Debian based distribution such as Ubuntu open a terminal and enter:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install flex bison

After having all the dependencies installed, there are two methods to build it

Method 1: Open a termnial, cd to language_desing implementation directory, such as
cd path/language_design. When you are in the correct directoy, enter the command
make and the language will be built automatimaticlly as a makefile is included.

Method 2:Open a termnial, cd to language_desing implementation directory, such as
cd path/language_design. When you are in the correct directoy, enter the following
commands one after the other as shown:

bison -d grammar.y
flex -l lexer.l
gcc grammar.tab.c lex.yy.c ast.c -o denise

Note: lex.yy.c is created by flex
      grammar.tab.h and grammar.tab.c are created by bison
